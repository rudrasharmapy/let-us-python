* There are several reasons for Python's popularity . These include:

(a) Free:
    - Python is free to use and distribute and is supported by community.
    - Python interpreter is available for every major platform
    
(b) Software quality:
    - Better than traditional and scripting languages.
    - Readable code, hence reusable and maintainable.
    - Support for advance reuse mechanisms.
    
(c) Developer Productivity: 
    - Much better than statically typed languages.
    - Much smaller code.
    - Less to type, debih and maintain.
    - No lengthy compile and link steps.
    
(d) Program portability:
    - Python programs run unchanged on most platforms.
    - Python runs on every major platform currently in use.
    - Porting proram to a new platform usually need only cut and paste. This is true even for GUI, DB access, Web programming, OS interfacing, Directory access, etc.
    
(e) Support libraries:
    - Strong library support from Tet pattern matching to networking.
    - vast collection of third party libraries.
    - Libraries for Web site construction, Numeric programming, Game development, Machine Learning etc.
    
(f) Component Integration:
    - Can invoke C, C++ libraries and Java components.
    - Can communicate with frameworks such as COM, .NET.
    - Can interact over networks with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, CORBA.
    - With appropriate glue code, Python can subclass C++, Java, C#. classes, thereby extending the reach of the program.
    - Popularly used for product customization and extension.
    
(g) Enjoyment:
    - Ease of use.
    - Built-in toolset.
    - Programming becomes pleasure than work.
